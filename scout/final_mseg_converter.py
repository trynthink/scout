"""Common input data census division to custom region conversion script.

This script takes a complete input JSON database in which all of the
data are specified on a census division basis and converts those data
to a custom region basis. The conversion procedure in this script can
modify any complete (i.e., both residential and commercial data added)
or partially complete JSON database, so long as the structure of each
microsegment is identical for all census divisions, but is default
configured to look for files that have complete residential and
commercial data.

The approach employed here relies on the user to run the input data
processing scripts in the correct order prior to running this script.
This approach was taken instead of creating a master script that
calls those other scripts itself to simplify debugging and modification
of the individual data import scripts and also to reduce the need to
re-run potentially slow code when it or another script encounters an
error when the master script calls them.

To help ensure that the scripts are run in the correct order, each
script checks for the correct input file and produces an instructive
error message if the file is missing.

class UsefulVars(object):
    """Class for useful variables to make them available to external scripts.

    This class is setup so that these variables are available, if
    necessary, to external functions for testing or other purposes.
    While this script can convert energy and stock data or cost,
    performance, and lifetime data, it cannot handle both in parallel.
    After creating an instance of the class, the appropriate method
    can be called to populate the instance with the correct file
    names for the input and output JSON databases and the census
    division to custom region conversion tables.

    It is conceivable that instead of having separate methods to
    set the values for the required variables for each case, they
    could be initialized for one case and modified using regular
    expressions, but the approach below is simple, if ham-fisted.

    The different census division to custom region conversion matrices
    are required because the correct math to combine cost, performance,
    and lifetime data is different than the math for energy and stock
    data. The '_Rev_' version of the conversion matrix has weighting
    factors scaled such that the columns (custom regions) sum to 1,
    which is required to calculate the weighted average of technology
    cost, performance, lifetime, etc. across the census divisions.
    Conversely, the energy, stock, and square footage conversion matrix
    is structured such that the census divisions sum to 1, since those
    data are originally recorded by census division, and all of the
    energy use reported must be accounted for when switching to
    custom regions.

    Currently, three custom region sets are supported: AIA climate regions,
    U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) National Energy Modeling
    System (NEMS) Electricity Market Module (EMM) regions, and (for stock/
    energy data only), states.

    Attributes:
        addl_cpl_data (str): File name for database of cost,
            performance, and lifetime data not found in the EIA data,
            principally for envelope components and miscellaneous
            electric loads.
        conv_factors (str): File name for database of unit conversion
            factors (principally costs) for a range of equipment types.
        aeo_metadata (str): File name for the custom AEO metadata JSON.
        geo_break (str): Indicates the intended geographical data breakdown.
        fuel_disagg_method (str): Indicates the intended fuel type choices.
        final_disagg_method (str): Indicates the intended analysis on either
            tech-level or end use-level analysis.

    Attributes: (if a method is called)
        res_climate_convert (str): File name for the residential buildings
            census division to custom region conversion data appropriate
            for the particular data to be converted.
        com_climate_convert (str): File name for the commercial buildings
            census division to custom region conversion data appropriate
            for the particular data to be converted.
        json_in (str): File name for the expected input JSON database.

    """Calculate values to restructure census division data to custom regions.

    Two dicts with identical structure, 'base_dict' and 'add_dict' are
    passed to this function and manipulated to effect conversion of the
    data from a census division (specified by 'cd_num') to a custom region
    (specified by 'reg_name') basis.

    This function operates recursively, traversing the structure of
    the input dicts until a list of years is reached. At that point,
    if the census division specified corresponds to the first census
    division in the original data, the entries in 'base_dict' are
    overwritten by the same data multiplied by the appropriate conversion
    factor. If the census division is not the first to appear in the original
    data, 'base_dict' has already been modified, and data from subsequent
    census divisions should be added to 'base_dict', thus 'add_dict' is
    modified to the current custom region using the appropriate
    conversion factor and added to 'base_dict'.

    This approach to converting the data to a custom region basis works
    because this function is called from within nested for loops that
    cover all of the census divisions for each custom region.
    Consequently, the data from each of the census divisions converted
    to their respective contributions to a single custom region can be
    added together to obtain the data in the desired final form.

    Args:
        base_dict (dict): A portion of the input JSON database
            corresponding to the current census division, modified in
            place to convert the data to a custom region basis.
        add_dict (dict): A portion of the input JSON database
            corresponding to the current census division, copied from
            the original input data each time this function is called
            by the clim_converter function. This portion of the data
            should be structurally identical to 'base_dict', and
            (generally) corresponds to the data that should be updated
            and then added to 'base_dict'.
        cd_num (int): The census division index (0-8) currently being
            processed.
        reg_name (int): The custom region name to which the census division
            data are being added.
        res_convert_array (numpy.ndarray): Coefficients for converting
            from census divisions to custom regions for residential buildings.
        com_convert_array (numpy.ndarray): Coefficients for converting
            from census divisions to custom regions for commercial buildings.
        cpl (bool): True if cpl data are being processed
        flag_map_dat (dict): Info. used to flag building types, fuel types,
            end uses, and map to NREL End Use Load Profiles (EULP) datasets.
        first_cd_flag (boolean): Flag for loop through the first census
            division in the input data.
        cd_to_cz_factor (float): The numeric conversion factor to
            calculate the contribution from the current census division
            'cd' to the current custom region 'cz'.
        bldg_flag (NoneType): Flag for the building type currently being looped
            through (relevant only to EMM/state custom region convert).
        fuel_flag (NoneType): Flag for the fuel type currently being looped
            through (relevant only to EMM/state custom region convert).
        eu_flag (NoneType): Flag for the end use currently being looped
            through (relevant only to EMM/state custom region convert)
        tech_flag (NoneType): Flag for the technology currently being looped
            through (relevant only to EMM/state custom region convert)
        stock_energy_flag (NoneType): Flag for the stock or energy
            through (relevant only to EMM/state custom region convert)
        key_list (list): Keys that specify the current location in the
            microsegments database structure and thus indicate what
            data should be returned by this function.

    Returns:
        A dict with the same form as base_dict and add_dict, with the
        values for the particular census division specified in 'cd'

    from the original data and restructures it into a form that is
    generally consistent with similar data originally obtained from
    the Annual Energy Outlook (AEO). These data are added to the input
    microsegments database after it is initially converted to a custom region
    basis, and these data are reported by AIA climate zone (if the data for a
    given envelope component are climate-specific).

    Args:
        cpl_data (dict): Cost, performance, and lifetime data for
            building envelope components (e.g., roofs, walls) including
            units and source information.
        cost_convert (dict): Cost unit conversions for envelope (and
            heating and cooling equipment, though those conversions are
            not used in this function) components, as well as the
            mapping from EnergyPlus building prototypes to AEO building
            types (as used in the microsegments file) to convert cost
            data from sources that use the EnergyPlus building types
            to the AEO building types.
        perf_convert (numpy ndarray): Performance value conversions for
            envelope components from AIA climate zone breakout to EMM
            region breakout (relevant only for EMM region translation).
        years (list): A list of integers representing the range of years
            in the data.
        key_list (list): Keys that specify the current location in the
            microsegments database structure and thus indicate what
            data should be returned by this function.
        aia_list (list): Expected AIA region names.
        cdiv_list (list): Expected Census Division names.
        emm_list (list): Expected EMM region names.

    Returns:
        A dict with installed cost, performance, and lifetime data
        applicable to the microsegment and envelope component specified
        by key_list, as well as units and source information for those
        data. All costs should have the units YYYY$/ft^2 floor, where
        YYYY is the year from which the data were obtained.
        These data are returned only if applicable for the envelope
        component that appears in key_list, and not for cases such as
        "people gain" for which there is no corresponding product that
        is part of the building.
