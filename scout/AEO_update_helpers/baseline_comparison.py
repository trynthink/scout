"""Baseline comparison between Scout microsegments and EIA AEO data.

Recommended usage
-----------------
Run this script from the project root as a module so imports and
relative paths resolve correctly, and so your API key can be picked up
from a ``.env`` file or environment variable::

    python -m scout.AEO_update_helpers.baseline_comparison --year 2025

You can optionally add ``--verbose`` to see extra diagnostic output.

Overview
--------
This script compares energy use from Scout's processed AEO JSON file to
summary values from the EIA Annual Energy Outlook (AEO) API.

High-level steps
----------------
1. Read the Scout microsegments JSON file.
2. For every combination of:
   - building class (residential, commercial)
   - fuel type (electricity, natural gas, distillate, other fuel)
   - end use (heating, cooling, lighting, etc.)
   we add up the energy in the JSON.
3. For the same combination, we query the EIA AEO API for the
   corresponding series and convert units so they match the JSON.
4. We compare the two sets of values year by year, compute the
   percent error, and print a short report.
5. At the end we also print simple rollup tables by building type
   and fuel.
