ECM Definition Reference
========================

In some parts of the definition of an ECM, specific values must be entered for the ECM to be valid and successfully included in an analysis. In particular, the installed cost and energy efficiency units used must match exactly with the expected units for a given building sector, end use, and technology type. These units are defined by the EIA Annual Energy Outlook data used to define the baseline technology cost, efficiency, and lifetime.

.. _ecm-applicable-baseline-market:

Applicable baseline market options
----------------------------------

For each of the keys in the applicable baseline market definition, only specific entries are expected and allowable. This section outlines those acceptable entries for each of the keys.

For some keys, there are shorthand summary values that can be used when all or a large group of more specific values for that key apply. For example, if all of the climate zones should be included in the applicable baseline market, the value "all" can be specified instead of typing out each climate zone name in a list. These shorthand values are provided after the semi-colon in the lists below. Additional notes might also be provided to further clarify the different summary values available for a given key. More information regarding the use of these shorthand values is in the :ref:`ecm-features-shorthand` section.

End use
~~~~~~~

The end use names appear verbatim in the first column of the tables for residential and commercial buildings.

.. note::

   While "all" is available for specifying all of the end uses in residential and/or commercial buildings (depending on the building types selected), its use should be limited to ECMs where a single technology can credibly affect all energy use in the building. Using the "all" option for end uses also significantly increases computational expense, and that expense will scale exponentially if uncertainty is present on any of the ECMs in the analysis.

.. _ecm-baseline_technology:

Technology
~~~~~~~~~~

Technology names appear verbatim. For residential building types, the lighting technology names are in the body of the table, categorized by illumination technology (e.g., incandescent, fluorescent) and application or fixture type. For commercial building types, the lighting technology names are categorized generally by bulb type or application. In both cases, these categories are provided for convenience and are not used anywhere in an ECM definition.

.. tip::
   If the technology name for a given end use and fuel type is indicated as ``null``, the ECM definition should have the *unquoted* text "null" written into the :ref:`json-technology` field.

.. note::
   "all" is available as an option to specify all of the technology names that apply to all of the building types, fuel types, and end uses specified for the applicable baseline market. In addition, "all" can be made specific to a particular end use by specifying "all" followed by the end use name -- "all heating" or "all water heating," for example. This shorthand will capture all of the technologies in the named end use that apply to the building types and fuel types included in the applicable baseline market. For example, if the building type is "single family homes" and the fuel type is specified as ["electricity", "natural gas"] then "all heating" will include all of the heating technologies for residential buildings that use electricity or natural gas.

.. _json-schema:

ECM JSON schema
---------------

This section outlines the elements of a JSON file that defines an energy conservation measure (ECM) -- a technology included for analysis with Scout. More details about ECMs can be found in the :ref:`Analysis Approach <analysis-step-1>` and :ref:`Tutorial 1 <tuts-1>` sections.

Each sub-section corresponds to a single key in the JSON. The details provided for each key include the parent and child fields, valid data types, a brief description of the field, and one or more illustrative examples. Parent keys are above and child keys are below the current key in the hierarchy of a JSON file. ::

   {"parent key": {
      "current key": {
         "child key": "value"}}}

The data type "none" indicates that ``null`` is a valid value for that key. The parent "root" indicates that it is at the top of the hierarchy, that is, there are no parents for that key.

.. _json-name:

If it is appropriate for the technology described by the ECM, the energy efficiency can be specified more precisely using one or more of the optional child fields. The values should then be reported in a dict where the keys correspond to the applicable child fields. If multiple levels of specificity are desired, the hierarchy of the nested keys must use the following order: :ref:`json-climate_zone`, :ref:`json-bldg_type`, :ref:`json-end_use` and :ref:`json-structure_type`.

.. _json-energy_efficiency_units:

energy_efficiency_units
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* **Parents:** root
* **Children:** (optional) matching :ref:`json-energy_efficiency`
* **Type:** string, dict

This field specifies the units of the reported energy efficiency values for the ECM. The correct energy efficiency units depend on the building type, end use, and in some cases, equipment type of the technology described by the ECM. The units can be determined using the :ref:`list of energy efficiency units <ecm-energy-efficiency-units>` in the :ref:`ecm-def-reference`. ::
   
   {...
    "energy_efficiency_units": "COP",
    ...}

In cases where the energy efficiency is specified with one or more of the optional keys, if the units are the same for all values, the units can still be reported with a single string. If the units are different for some of the keys used, a dict with a structure parallel to the energy efficiency data should be used to report the units. (Energy efficiency units are not a function of climate zone and do not have to be specified with a climate zone breakdown even if the efficiency varies by climate zone.) ::

   {...

         "all residential": "COP",
         "small office": "BTU out/BTU in"}},
    ...}

.. Energy efficiency can also be specified with relative units, as described in the :ref:`ecm-features-relative-savings` section, using EnergyPlus data, explained in the :ref:`ecm-features-energyplus` section, or with probability distributions on some or all values, detailed in the :ref:`ecm-features-distributions` section.

* **Parents:** root
* **Children:** (optional) values from :ref:`json-bldg_type`, :ref:`json-structure_type`
* **Type:** int, dict

The installed cost field represents the typical total cost of the technology and installation of the technology into a building. Costs should be specified such that they are consistent with the :ref:`required units <ecm-installed-cost-units>` for the type of technology described by the ECM. ::

   {...
    "installed cost": 14,
    ...}

Since installation costs can vary by building type (implicitly by building square footage) and whether the technology is being installed as part of new construction or as a replacement of existing equipment or renovation of an existing building, the costs can be specified in a dict using the indicated optional child fields. The keys should match exactly with the allowable values for each of those fields. ::

   {...
    "installed_cost": {
      "all residential": 8,
      "all commercial": 10},
    ...}

The installed costs can be specified with detail beyond what is shown using the additional optional child field types, as illustrated for the :ref:`json-energy_efficiency` field. The order of the hierarchy is: :ref:`json-bldg_type`, :ref:`json-structure_type`. Further information about detailed structures for specifying the installed cost is in the :ref:`ecm-features-detailed-input` section.

   {...
    "cost_units": "$/1000 lm",
    }

If there is only a single cost value, a single units value should be given; if the installed cost is specified by one or more of the optional keys and the various installed costs have different units, the cost units should be specified with the same dict structure as the costs. (Cost units are not a function of climate zone and do not have to be specified with a climate zone breakdown even if the costs vary by climate zone.) ::

Multiple scaling fraction values can share the same source so long as the calculation procedure for all of the values is provided in the :ref:`json-fraction_derivation` field, however, no more than one source is allowed for each scaling fraction value. If scaling fractions correspond to different sources, the source information can be given in a nested dict with the same top level structure as the scaling fractions themselves. If the market scaling fraction is set to 1 for one of the keys in the nested structure, the source information can be given as a string explaining any assumptions. ::

The final type of time sensitive ECM feature applies hourly savings fractions to baseline loads in accordance with a custom savings shape that represents either a typical day or all 8760 hours of the year. 

In the first case, custom hourly savings for a typical day are defined in the :ref:`json-custom-save-day` parameter; the hourly savings are specified as a list with 24 elements, with each element representing the fraction of hourly baseline load that an ECM saves. These hourly savings are applied for each day of the year in the range defined by the :ref:`json-start_day` and :ref:`json-stop_day` parameters, as for the shed and shift features.

In the second case, the custom savings shape represents hourly load impacts for all 8760 hours in the `reference year`_. Here, the measure definition links to a supporting CSV file via the :ref:`json-custom-save-ann` parameter that is expected to be present in the |html-filepath| ./ecm_definitions/energyplus_data/savings_shapes |html-fp-end| folder, with one CSV per measure JSON in |html-filepath| ./ecm_definitions |html-fp-end| that uses this feature. ::
