      "cooling multiple of 37% was determined by dividing square feet in which cooling equipment is residential split system or individual AC unit AND heating equipment is not natural gas or electric (13428155 sf) by square feet with same cooling constraint and heating across all fossil fuel types (36556957 sf). Ventilation multiples determined by square feet in which given ventilation system (VAV or CAV) is paired with given heating system for the measure."
